slam_gmapping
=============

This package contains a ROS2 Crystal Clemmys wrapper for OpenSlam's Gmapping.
        The gmapping package provides laser-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping),
        as a ROS node called slam_gmapping. Using slam_gmapping, you can create a 2-D occupancy
        grid map (like a building floorplan) from laser and pose data collected by a mobile robot.
